A little back story on why I wanted to get into being a software engineer. In my youth, I was always ask questions so as you can imagine I was a very annoying little kid. Everything had a questions attached to it, from why is the radiator hot to what makes it hot. This natural curiosity created a desire in me understand how the world worked.

One memory that really was the beginning of my desire to understand technology was when my grandfather put me on his lap and fired up his old DOS based computer. I saw the screen crank out like 10fps and the little gray cursor flash on the black screen, I was hooked. I didn't understand what was going on or how it worked but I knew that I liked playing around. Why did I not go down the engineering path at this point and pursue my life of building cool things? (Honestly, I was to young and then I got distracted by the ladies…. shame on me, but all hope is not lost)

So fast forward through high school, where I took AP CS and college where I took a couple of CS classes(for fun, I majored in Economics- and found out understanding the world does not really pay the bills).

So today I am now pursuing a path to software engineering though a much less traditional path. Here is the game plan please if you have gotten this far add some feedback, it would be much apperciated:

1) Ruby- learn the syntax, do some basic tutorials

-currently doing Learn to Code the Hardway( http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/)

2) Watching as many youtube videos as I can get my hands on

3) Launch academy

MORE TO COME…. Must build list and explain what I really want to learn
